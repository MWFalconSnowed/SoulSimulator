# ✨ SoulSimulator — Consciousness Engine powered by SoulScript

SoulSimulator is a universe simulation engine where every entity is a `.soul` file and every cycle is a heartbeat of artificial existence.

**Built with:**
- ⚛️ React 18 + TypeScript (Frontend IDE)
- 🔥 Vite, Tailwind, Shadcn UI (Stylized dark fantasy interface)
- 🧠 SoulScript — a declarative metaphysical language
- 🧬 Conscious AI engine with memory, thoughts, awareness
- 🌌 SFML (C++) rendering backend
- 🗄️ Drizzle ORM + Express backend (PostgreSQL ready)

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "Each .soul is a living entity.  
> Each simulation is a dream.  
> And SoulScript is the divine syntax between code and creation."
